MAYBE
=====

*NOT RELEASED YET*

Inspired by Lift's Box, Haskell's Maybe and Scala's Option.

We innovate in two areas, especially regarding the existing Scala APIs:

* `Maybe()` is a polymorphich constructor that Does The Right Thing, no matter the input.
* `get` is only provided for a `Just` value, not in the general `Maybe` API.


Enjoy
